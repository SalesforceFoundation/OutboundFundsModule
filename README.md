**Important note about Funding Requests as of July 2019**:
If you were an early adopter of the Outbound Funds package, the Funding Request object had a master-detail relationship with Funding Program when you installed it. However, various members of the community requested that this relationship be changed to a lookup to provide more flexibility. This change was made generally available with package version 1.15 as of 7/11/2019. To learn about updating to version 1.15, see the [Funding Request Object documentation](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/OutboundFundsModule/wiki/Funding-Request-Object).
